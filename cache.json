I'm going to share my experience how to configure reverse proxy and SSL encryption with NGINX. I'm pretty sure you guys have heard what is reverse proxy. If you don't, don't sweat!. </p>\n<hr/>\n<h3> What is reverse proxy? </h3>\n<p> Reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers. With reverse proxy, when a client send requests to an origin server, those requests are intercepted at the network edge by the reverse proxy server. The reverse proxy server then send those requests to the origin server. </p>\n<h3> Why do we use reverse proxy? </h3>\n<p> There are actually many benefits using reverse proxy such as SSL Encryption, Load Balancing, Caching, etc. </p>\n<h3> How to implement reverse proxy? </h3>\n<p> Open source software such as NGINX and Apache are popular and widely used by people. </p>\n<h3> Let's get start! </h3>\n<p> In this tutorial, I'm going to use Droplet for setting up a virtual machine. But you guys feel free to use other cloud hosting platforms (EC2 or Cloud Compute) since the environment will be similar. </p>\n<p> (1) Set up a virtual machine.\n(2) Download & install NGINX from package manager.\n(3) Check if NGINX is running on port 80.\n(4) Git clone a dummy server.\n(5) install pm2.\n(6) Edit NGINX.conf in etc/nginx/nginx.conf.\n(7) Download & install CertBot from package manager.\n(8) Forward port 80 to 443. </P>","positive_reactions_count":0,"cover_image":null,"tag_list":["nginx","node","cloud"],"canonical_url":"https://dev.to/wildanazz/create-a-nginx-configuration-for-reverse-proxy-on-droplet-35mb","reading_time_minutes":1,"user":{"name":"Wildan Aziz","username":"wildanazz","twitter_username":null,"github_username":"wildanazz","user_id":873881,"website_url":null,"profile_image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MDREkI21--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/873881/75d636c4-9e38-48fd-a32b-1ebcae531d1c.jpeg","profile_image_90":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FfMc19EM--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/873881/75d636c4-9e38-48fd-a32b-1ebcae531d1c.jpeg"}},{"type_of":"article","id":1457995,"title":"Create and Deploy MERN Stack Application with Kubernetes","description":"git clone https://github.com/wildanazz/minote","published":true,"published_at":"2023-05-05T01:28:43.004Z","slug":"create-and-deploy-mern-application-with-on-kubernetes-4f06","path":"/wildanazz/create-and-deploy-mern-application-with-on-kubernetes-4f06","url":"https://dev.to/wildanazz/create-and-deploy-mern-application-with-on-kubernetes-4f06","comments_count":0,"public_reactions_count":0,"page_views_count":7,"published_timestamp":"2023-05-05T01:28:43Z","body_markdown":"`git clone https://github.com/wildanazz/minote`","positive_reactions_count":0,"cover_image":null,"tag_list":["docker","kubernetes","express","mongodb"],"canonical_url":"https://dev.to/wildanazz/create-and-deploy-mern-application-with-on-kubernetes-4f06","reading_time_minutes":1,"user":{"name":"Wildan Aziz","username":"wildanazz","twitter_username":null,"github_username":"wildanazz","user_id":873881,"website_url":null,"profile_image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MDREkI21--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/873881/75d636c4-9e38-48fd-a32b-1ebcae531d1c.jpeg","profile_image_90":"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FfMc19EM--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/873881/75d636c4-9e38-48fd-a32b-1ebcae531d1c.jpeg"}},{"type_of":"article","id":1436464,"title":"Build a Graph Convolutional Network Model on Facebook Dataset","description":"A Graph Convolutional Network, or GCN, is an approach for semi-supervised learning on...","published":true,"published_at":"2023-04-26T10:31:45.135Z","slug":"gcn-on-facebook-dataset-4aed","path":"/wildanazz/gcn-on-facebook-dataset-4aed","url":"https://dev.to/wildanazz/gcn-on-facebook-dataset-4aed","comments_count":0,"public_reactions_count":0,"page_views_count":13,"published_timestamp":"2023-04-26T10:31:45Z","body_markdown":"A Graph Convolutional Network, or GCN, is an approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data. It is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs.
